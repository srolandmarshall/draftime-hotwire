# DRAFTime

## A custom draft tool that doesn't suck.

- Do you hate drafting with Yahoo, ESPN, or anyone else's online draft tool?
- Are you the only technologically sufficient member of your league?
- Do you wish you could have a simple export to deal with that automatically works with all the leagues?

Well then _DRAFTime_ might be for you.

DRAFTime is currently in pre-alpha stage. It is not yet in a hostable manner. It requires Ruby and PostGres, but nothing beyond that, I'm pretty sure. If you don't know what those are and how to install them, you shouldn't be using this application.

To get started:

- `clone` this repo locally
- `cd` to the repo
- `bundle install`
- `rake db:migrate`
- `rake db:seed`
- `rails s`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`
